# test_statistics

This is a collection of some javaScript code examples where I am working out a few things that have to do with statistics. Much of what I work out here might end up being used in my [blog posts on statistics](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/statistics/), if so mush of it should be found in the forpost folder of this repository.
